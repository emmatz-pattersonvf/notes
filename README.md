- Today's programming wisdom is to always prioritize code readability and maintainability. This means writing concise, well-structured, and easy-to-understand code that can be easily modified and expanded upon as needed. To achieve this, follow these best practices:

1. Use clear variable, function, method, class, module, etc. names that accurately reflect their purpose and functionality.
2. Organize code into logical, modular blocks that follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and minimize complexity. Break large tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. 
3. Comment your code to explain its purpose, input, output, assumptions, edge cases, errors, or anything else that may not be obvious to someone reading the code. Avoid excessive commenting, however, as it can clutter the Code and make it harder to read. Instead, use well written code with good variable names and function/method signatures.  
4. Write code in a way that follows best practice patterns and conventions. For example, in JavaScript, prefer using the arrow function (`() => {}`) over a regular function declaration (e.g., `function myFunction() {}`), as arrow functions do not bind their own `this` value. Similarly, always use curly braces ({}), even for single-line blocks, to avoid accidental code execution.   
5. Always run code through a linter (like ESLint or Prettier) to catch common coding errors and style issues. Linters can help you maintain a consistent coding style and reduce the chances of introducing bugs. They can also suggest code improvements, such as removing unnecessary lines or converting a ternary operator into a simpler if/else statement.    
6. Learn and use version control systems (VCS), like Git, for tracking code changes, collaborating with teammates, fixing and resolving merge conflicts, revering bad commits, tagging releases, backing up your work, among other useful features. VCS can significantly improve your productivity and code quality.     
7. Continuously learn and keep up with the latest programming trends, languages, frameworks, libraries, tools, best-practices, security vulnerabilities, performance optimizations, debugging techniques, version-control systems, collaboration tools (such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gerrit, CodeReview, Jira, Slack, Mattermost, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, Mastodon, Reddit, Stack Overflow, GitHub Forums, Dev.to, Hacker News, Medium, Blog.academy, dev.git.beta, Devexpress, FreeCodeCamp, LeetCode, Codecademy), and so on. Staying informed and up-do-date with these technologies and practices will help make you a better programmer.
