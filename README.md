- "Today's programming wisdom is to focus on writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. Invest time in planning and design, use appropriate data structures and algorithms, and always strive to improve your skills and knowledge. Remember that code is read more often than it is written, so make it easy to understand and debug. Lastly, don't be afraid to ask for help or collaborate with others in the programming community."
